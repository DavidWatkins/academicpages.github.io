excerpt: 'Compiling high level programming languages into hardware is no small task. It requires dividing the program into constituent parts that are representable by a hardware circuit and creating a proper memory management system that can fit on a single hardware circuit. Designing a memory system that can reduce contention requires analysis of the dataflow circuit generated from the high level program and can be determined using a graph coloring algorithm and using a separate memory system for each color of the graph. This will reduce memory contention and allow the system to work faster overall.'
