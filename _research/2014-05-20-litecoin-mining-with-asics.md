Cooperated with Professor Simha Sethumadhavan on the feasibility of producing Litecoin Mining ASICs. Independently designed all of the ASIC schematics, performed cost-benefit analysis of the ASICS, maintained knowledge on which crypto-currencies were most profitable at any time, and wrote scripts in Java and VHDL for design and analysis. Communicated with Professor Sethumadhavan about software and referring me to emerging technologies in ASICs

*Abstract:* The world of crypto-currency is currently driven by Bitcoin due to its support from ASICs. There is an opportunity to build ASICs for Scrypt Cryptocurrencies so that they can flourish as well.
