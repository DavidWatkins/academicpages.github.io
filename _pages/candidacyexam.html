    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>As robots become more pervasive in our world,  there is the challenge of how to  make  them  learn  faster  and  better  adapt  to  different  tasks  and  scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods are being increasingly applied to a range of robotics  control tasks albeit RL research in real robot applications has not been able to match the success of RL in games and simulation. Since humans have a high level mastery of most tasks that robots learn,  they can provide explicit or implicit reward signals during robot learning.  This talk will overview the current state of the art RL approaches to robot learning-- including ways human experts can intuitively provide guidance to the robot learning process</p>
